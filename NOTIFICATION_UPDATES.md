# Notification System Updates

## Overview
Updated the Profile page notification system to provide better user feedback and client management capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Toggle Feedback
- **Modified `handleNotificationToggle` function** to show immediate feedback when any notification toggle is changed
- Added toast notifications that confirm the setting change
- Shows which client and which setting was updated (enabled/disabled)

```typescript
const handleNotificationToggle = (client: string, setting: 'emailViews' | 'resumeViews' | 'responses', value: boolean) => {
  setNotificationSettings(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [client]: {
      ...prev[client],
      [setting]: value
    }
  }));
  
  // Show update confirmation
  toast({
    title: "Settings Updated",
    description: `${setting.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + setting.slice(1)} notifications for ${client} have been ${value ? 'enabled' : 'disabled'}.`,
  });
};
```

### 2. Client Disconnect Functionality
- **Added `handleClientDisconnect` function** to allow users to disconnect from any connected client
- Shows confirmation toast when a client is disconnected
- Updated the UI to show "Disconnect Client" button for connected clients

```typescript
const handleClientDisconnect = (client: string) => {
  setClientConnections(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [client]: false
  }));
  
  toast({
    title: "Client Disconnected",
    description: `Disconnected from ${client}. Notifications will no longer be sent through this client.`,
    variant: "destructive",
  });
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Client Connection Management
- **Improved `handleClientConnect` function** with toast feedback
- Shows success confirmation when connecting to a client

### 4. Dynamic Connect/Disconnect Buttons
- **Updated the notification section UI** to show appropriate buttons based on connection status:
  - **Disconnected clients**: Show "Connect to [Client]" button
  - **Connected clients**: Show "Disconnect Client" button (destructive variant)
- Buttons are positioned at the bottom right of the notification settings for each client

### 5. Global Update Button
- **Added "Update All Notification Settings" button** at the bottom of the notification section
- Provides a way to confirm all changes made to notification preferences
- Shows comprehensive success message when clicked

```typescript
<Button 
  onClick={() => {
    toast({
      title: "All Settings Updated",
      description: "All notification preferences have been saved successfully.",
    });
  }}
  className="w-full"
  variant="default"
>
  <Bell className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
  Update All Notification Settings
</Button>
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Immediate Feedback

- Users know exactly what was changed and for which client
- Clear success/error messaging for all actions

### Client Management

- Clear visual indication of connection status
- Consistent button positioning and styling

### Comprehensive Updates
- Global update button for batch confirmation
- Full notification preferences management
- Maintains individual client settings independence

## Technical Benefits

### State Management

- Preserves individual client notification preferences
- Clean separation of connection and notification states

### Toast Integration
- Consistent use of the existing toast system
- Appropriate toast variants (default for updates, destructive for disconnects)
- Clear, informative messages

### UI Consistency

- Proper button variants and positioning
- Responsive layout preservation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Toggle Testing**: Verify that each notification toggle shows appropriate toast messages
2. **Connection Testing**: Test connect/disconnect functionality for all clients
3. **State Persistence**: Ensure settings persist across component re-renders
4. **Global Update**: Verify the "Update All Settings" button provides appropriate feedback
5. **Cross-Client Testing**: Test notification settings independence between different clients

## Future Enhancements

1. **API Integration**: Connect notification updates to backend API endpoints
2. **Real-time Sync**: Implement real-time synchronization of notification settings
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk enable/disable for multiple notification types
4. **Client-specific Settings**: Add advanced settings per client type
5. **Notification History**: Track and display notification delivery history
